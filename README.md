# Tenkan

Convert your manga backups from service A to B

## Production website

Go [here](https://manga.kingbri.dev) to access the public website

## Why did we make this?

This site was originally made to convert and upload manga backups to RemoteStorage for [Cubari.moe](https://cubari.moe), but there's a bigger issue at play.

Manga apps in general can be a huge pain to work with, especially if you lose your device or if the app suddenly dies. How does a user migrate
a manga library when another app comes along?

This is where Tenkan comes in. Tenkan allows users to easily convert their manga backups between apps. Now, when a user loads the library on a new app,
they don't miss a beat.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the [production website](https://manga.kingbri.dev)
2. Click the button pertaining to your manga app
3. Upload your backup file
4. Watch the console on your screen
5. If you can download a backup, download it. If you are on cubari, use [Inspektor](https://inspektor.5apps.com) to see if your files were imported

## Running yourself

1. Clone the project
2. Run `yarn install` to add all packages (you can also use npm)
3. Run `yarn dev` to immediately start up the next server

## Contribution
